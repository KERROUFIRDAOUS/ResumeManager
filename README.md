Recruitment is a lengthy and challenging process, yet it is a fundamental tool for enhancing a company's competitiveness and performance, serving as a crucial step in its development.

For every job opening, numerous applications pour in via email, social media messages, and phone calls. Managing and processing these responses across different channels can be time-consuming and labor-intensive.

The majority of recruitment-related issues stem from the fact that the selection procedure often lacks automation and digitization.

To address this problem and support recruiters, we came up with the idea of developing a web application for CV management.

Our application aims to streamline the process for candidates by allowing them to apply online through a single form. Simultaneously, it automates certain repetitive and time-consuming tasks for recruiters.

The primary objective of our application, called 'ResumeManager,' is to facilitate more effective evaluation of candidates, particularly in the context of collaborative recruitment.

By leveraging ResumeManager, recruiters can enhance their recruitment workflows, expedite the screening and shortlisting process, and improve overall efficiency.

Our application offers a user-friendly interface, advanced filtering options, and collaborative features to ensure seamless collaboration among hiring team members.

With ResumeManager, we strive to revolutionize the way recruitment is conducted, leveraging technology to optimize the candidate selection process and enable recruiters to make data-driven decisions.
